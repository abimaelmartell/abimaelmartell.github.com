  <p>Hi, my name is Abimael Martell, i'm a Software Developer from Tijuana, MÃ©xico. I've been working for over ten years with different companies around the world doing what i love. My favorite stack is Ruby on Rails with React</p>

  <p>I like to focus on testing, and having pipelines setup to ensure code quality on every commit helps me to stay productive.</p>

  <p>I love learning new technologies and i try to keep up with the latest stuff. Like most developers i have a lot of unfinished projects on my computer ðŸ˜…. I use them to experiment and apply what i learn.</p>

  <p>I spend my free time with my wife and my kid, and enjoy doing Music, Photography and Bike rides.</p>
