  <p>Hi, I'm Abimael Martell, a full‑stack software engineer in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <p>For more than a decade I've helped startups and enterprises turn ideas into reliable software. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, React, and TypeScript. Clean tests and solid CI/CD keep my commits green.</p>
  
  <h2>How I work</h2>
  
  <p>I focus on maintainability, code reviews, and shipping features fast without breaking things. I set up pipelines, monitor performance, and automate everything that can be automated.</p>
  
  <h2>What I'm exploring now</h2>
  
  <p>Edge functions, AI powered developer tools, and better ways to tame flaky tests.</p>
  
  <h2>Outside work</h2>
  
  <p>Life is busy and fun with my wife and kids. Away from the keyboard I’m usually recording music, pulling espresso shots, shooting photos, or cycling around the city. Our family is active in our local church community, and we love playing local tourists across Baja.</p>
  
  <h2>Let's build something</h2>
  
  <p>If you need a hands on engineer who can own a project end to end, I'm available for full time or freelance work. Drop me a line or connect on LinkedIn.</p>
